# GitHub Demo by Duncan Levear

This repository is used to help demonstrate contributing to a GitHub repository. 

## Contributing to GitHub
The basic steps are:

1. (any initial computer setup steps, like installing and configuring `git`)
1. `git clone` the repository
1. make a change with `vim`
1. `git add` for "staging" your commit
1. `git commit` for making a commit out of whatever's in "staging"
1. `git push` sending your commits to the remote

See the `cpp` directory for a demo C++ program. See the `py` directory for a demo Python script.

# Markdown
This file uses Markdown. We can do **bold text** or *italicized text* or `monospace` text.

GitHub also lets you type emojis, such as: 

- :apple: `:apple:`
- :peach: `:peach:`
- :clubs: `:clubs:`
- :bird: `:bird:`
- :whale: `:whale:`
